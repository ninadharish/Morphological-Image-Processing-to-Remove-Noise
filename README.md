# Morphological Image Processing to Remove Noise

## Description

Given a binary image with noise, Morphological Operations are used to remove this noise. In this case, an image of a number of coins is given, where these coins are not distinct due to noise. Using morphological operations, these coins are separated out and counted.


## Data

The noisy binary image considered here is as below:

## Approach

* Each frame from the video is extracted and converted from RBG to HSV color space.

* Each frame is masked for the red color.

* The coordinates of these contours are extracted and the top and bottom points are stored considering the max and min values.

* Considering all of these points, Curve Fitting is done using the Normal Equation of the Standard Least Squares Method.
